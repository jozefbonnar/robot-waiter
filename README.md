# Robot Waiter

A software solution for an autonomous robot waiter designed to serve customers in bars and restaurants.

## Project Overview

This project implements a robot waiter capable of:
1. Identifying customers who need service
2. Navigating to their table
3. Taking orders through speech recognition
4. Returning to the bar/kitchen to relay orders
5. Serving customers efficiently

The system was developed for simulation environments with the capability to be deployed on real robot hardware.

## Key Components

### Navigation

#TODO

### Speech Recognition

The speech recognition system is responsible for:
- Listening to customer input
- Taking down orders
- Confirming orders
- Relaying the information to the waiter


### Computer Vision

The vision system is responsible for:
- Detecting customers who are waving for service
- Detecting the distance from the customer


## Development and Testing

The solution was  developed in simulation environments. This approach allowed for rapid iteration and testing of algorithms before deployment in real-world settings.

## Team

This project was developed as part of CMP2804 - Team Software Engineering at the University of Lincoln.
